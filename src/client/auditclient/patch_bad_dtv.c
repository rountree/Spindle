/**
 * This file works around a glibc problem when LD_AUDIT is enable, where the DTV (dynamic thread vector)
 * gets allocated using ld.so's rtld_malloc function, then later gets resized by libc.so's realloc function
 * (SPINDLE_SRC/scripts/dtvtest/ has a reproducer that can make this happen--you need lots of libraries with TLS). 
 * 
 * We'll work around this problem by A) recognizing when this will happen, and B) copying the DTV to a 
 * memory region properly controlled by libc.so's malloc. 
 * We recognize this because in the buggy case, the DTV will change values twice before libc.so enters a 
 * consistent state. 
 * We copy the DTV to a proper malloc region by getting its pointer out of TLS space. DTV is a vector, and
 * dtv[-1] is the vector size, which makes it not-to-difficult to get copies. We're relying on the structure
 * of libc internals to do this safely, but those internals don't look to have changed over the lifetime of
 * this bug.

/**
 * This dtv_t structure is copied from glibc source internals. That's kind of not safe,
 * but also kind of safe because the structure is consistent through the lifetime of the
 * bug we're working around, and seems to have stayed consistent for even longer.
